# TOneighbourhoods-K-Mean-Clusters

Using Toronto neighbourhood profiles based on 2016 Census Data, exploratory analysis was done with a variety of neighbourhood metrics, such as density, household size, age, and commute modes. This analysis dives into owner vs renter shares, as well as commute mode shares. When plotting out Ownership Rate and Commute Mode Score (a field I calculated as an indicator for how walkable a neighbourhood is), I noticed a trend where higher rates of home ownership generally meant lower levels of residents commuting by walk/bike/transit, but there were clusters evident even within that trend.

The interesting thing about clustering is being able to analyze sub-groups and how they differ, despite any general trends in the data. With 140 different neighbourhoods there are interesting insights into how people live, especially given the city's diversity. A further study might bring income levels into the analysis.
